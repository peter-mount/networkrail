/**
 * The <a href="http://www.delayattributionboard.co.uk/documents/dag_pdac/April%202013%20DAG.pdf">Delay Attribution
 * Guide</a> contains a list of delay attribution codes and reasons. The same codes are used in Train Cancellation
 * messages sent on the Train Movements feed. The current (April 2013) codes are listed here for reference.
 * <p>
 * Codes are grouped in to several sections:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A* - Freight terminal operating company causes</li>
 * <li>F* - Freight operating company causes</li>
 * <li>I* and J* - Infrastructure causes</li>
 * <li>M* and N* - Mechanical and Fleet Engineer causes</li>
 * <li>O* - Network Rail operating causes</li>
 * <li>P* - Planned or Excluded delays or cancellations</li>
 * <li>Q* - Network Rail non-operating causes</li>
 * <li>R* - Station operating company causes</li>
 * <li>T* - Passenger operating company causes</li>
 * <li>V* - Passenger Charter excludable (TOC responsibility) causes</li>
 * <li>X* - Passenger Charter excludable (Network Rail responsibility) causes</li>
 * <li>Y* - Reactionary delays</li>
 * <li>Z* - Unexplained delays and cancellations</li>
 * </ul>
